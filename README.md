### Description

IP Break Out Box is a program that sits between a client program and a server. Once activated it displays every bit of data exchanged between the client and the server. Example: Set the remote host = www.yahoo.com, remote and local port = 80, Then click listen. next open up your web browser and type in the ip address this is displayed in the local box. and poof all the html code, binary pictures ect are displayed in the black textbox. I used this to learn how to write my NT SMTP server service. Have Fun!! BTW this program is emailware if you find it usefull email me at mdown@un-wiredweb.com (when i get it up..)
